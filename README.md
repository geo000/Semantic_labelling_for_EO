# Spectral Indicies

I have spent alot of time fiddling with different spectral indicies whilst labelling training data. 
I built a class to speed up the proccess. 

Inputs should be numpy arrays.

## Arguments

s2bandn - Refers to sentinel 2 bands. 
Specific information about sentinel 1A and sentinel 2A can be found ![here]https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument
