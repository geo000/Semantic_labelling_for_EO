# Spectral Indicies

I have spent alot of time fiddling with different spectral indicies whilst labelling training data. 
I built a class to speed up the proccess. 

Inputs should be numpy arrays.

## Arguments

s2bandn - Refers to sentinel 2 bands. 
Specific information about sentinel 1A and sentinel 2A can be found [here](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument)

Futher information about sentinel 2 is [here] (https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685211/Sentinel-2+Products+Specification+Document+%28PSD%29/0f7bedeb-9fbb-4b60-91aa-809162de456c)
